# Chat Message Fix

This directory contains a fix for the chat message handling in the CLI client. The issue is that chat messages sent from one CLI client to another are not being displayed in the receiving client's UI.

## The Issue

The problem is in the `HandleControlMessage` method in `receive.go`. When it receives a chat message (type "message"), it simply returns nil without doing anything with the message:

```go
case "message":
    // Chat messages are handled by the channels component
    return nil
```

However, the Receiver is being used as the message handler in the Channels setup, so it needs to properly handle chat messages.

## How to Apply the Fix

You can apply the fix in one of the following ways:

### Option 1: Using the patch file

```bash
cd cli/transfer
patch < chat_fix.patch
```

### Option 2: Using the fix script

```bash
cd cli/transfer
chmod +x fix_chat_direct.sh
./fix_chat_direct.sh
```

### Option 3: Manual fix

1. Open `receive.go` in your editor
2. Find the "message" case in the `HandleControlMessage` method
3. Replace:
   ```go
   case "message":
       // Chat messages are handled by the channels component
       return nil
   ```
   
   With:
   ```go
   case "message":
       // Handle chat message
       content, ok := message["content"].(string)
       if !ok {
           return fmt.Errorf("invalid message format: missing content")
       }
       
       // Display the chat message
       r.logger.AppendChat(fmt.Sprintf("[yellow]Peer[white] %s", content))
       return nil
   ```

## After Applying the Fix

After applying the fix, rebuild the CLI client:

```bash
cd cli
go build -o p2pftp-cli
```

Now chat messages should be properly displayed in the CLI client when received from a peer.
