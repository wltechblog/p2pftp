# Project Progress

## Current Status
We are in the process of revising the P2PFTP implementation to simplify the protocol by leveraging WebRTC's built-in reliability guarantees. We have removed the web implementation to focus on fixing the CLI client first.

## What Works
- Signaling server implementation for WebRTC connection establishment
- Basic WebSocket communication between server and clients
- Token-based peer identification

## What Needs Improvement
- CLI client implementation needs to be fixed:
  - Data channel configuration needs to match the protocol specification
  - Capabilities exchange needs to be properly implemented
  - Chunk size limits need to be standardized
- File transfer robustness and error handling
- Connection recovery mechanisms
- Progress reporting and user feedback

## Current Focus
We are currently focusing on:
1. Fixing the CLI client implementation to follow the protocol specification
2. Addressing the data transfer issues identified in our analysis
3. Testing the CLI implementation thoroughly before rebuilding the web interface

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Protocol and Server Validation**
   - [x] Document existing implementation issues
   - [x] Update PROTOCOL.md with simplified approach
   - [x] Validate signaling server against updated specification
   - [x] Remove web implementation to focus on CLI client
   - [x] Simplify server implementation to focus on signaling only

2. **Phase 2: CLI Client Fixes**
   - [ ] Fix data channel configuration in Go implementation
     - Set the `negotiated` flag and pre-negotiated IDs as specified in the protocol
   - [ ] Implement proper capabilities exchange with acknowledgment
   - [ ] Standardize chunk size limits to match the protocol specification
   - [ ] Test CLI-to-CLI transfers thoroughly

3. **Phase 3: Web Client Rebuild**
   - [ ] Once CLI client is stable, rebuild web interface from scratch
   - [ ] Ensure strict adherence to protocol specification
   - [ ] Test browser-to-browser and CLI-to-browser transfers

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement**
   - [ ] Test with various file sizes and network conditions
   - [ ] Implement connection recovery mechanisms
   - [ ] Improve progress reporting and user feedback

## Identified Data Transfer Issues
After analyzing the code and protocol documentation, we identified several issues:

1. **Data Channel Configuration Mismatch**: The Go implementation is not setting the `negotiated` flag and pre-negotiated IDs as specified in the protocol.

2. **Capabilities Exchange Issues**: The Go implementation sends capabilities but doesn't properly handle the acknowledgment with the negotiated chunk size.

3. **Chunk Size Mismatch**: The Go implementation uses a maximum chunk size of 8184 bytes, while the JavaScript implementation uses a maximum of 65528 bytes.

## Server Validation Results
After reviewing the signaling server implementation, we found that it correctly implements the signaling protocol as defined in our updated specification:

1. **Token Assignment**: The server generates and assigns unique tokens to clients upon connection.
2. **Connection Request/Response**: The server correctly forwards connection requests and responses between peers.
3. **SDP Offer/Answer Exchange**: The server properly handles the forwarding of SDP offers and answers.
4. **ICE Candidate Exchange**: The server correctly forwards ICE candidates between peers.

The signaling server implementation is minimal and focused on its core responsibility: facilitating the initial connection between peers. It doesn't need to understand the WebRTC data channel protocol or the file transfer protocol, as those are handled directly between peers after the connection is established.

## Next Immediate Steps
- [x] Update PROTOCOL.md with our simplified approach
- [x] Validate the signaling server implementation
- [x] Remove web implementation to focus on CLI client
- [ ] Fix data channel configuration in Go implementation
- [ ] Implement proper capabilities exchange in Go client
- [ ] Standardize chunk size limits between implementations
- [ ] Test CLI implementation thoroughly
