# Project Brief

## Core Objectives
- Peer-to-peer file transfer system using WebRTC
- Browser-based client interface with native backend
- Secure direct device-to-device communication
- Transfer resumption and chunking support

## Key Components
- WebRTC signaling server (Go implementation)
- File transfer protocol (documented in PROTOCOL.md)
- Browser-based UI (static/js modules)
- Native client implementation (Go packages)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Establish complete signaling workflow
- [ ] Implement base file transfer protocol
- [ ] Achieve browser-to-client connectivity
- [ ] Enable multi-gigabyte file transfers
