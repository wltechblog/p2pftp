# Session Summary

## Accomplishments

1. **Identified Key Issues**:
   - CLI client implementation issues (deadlocks and race conditions with TUI)
   - Protocol implementation differences between clients
   - Need for a more rigid and clear specification

2. **Updated Protocol Specification**:
   - Simplified the protocol to leverage WebRTC's built-in reliability
   - Made capabilities exchange mandatory
   - Replaced per-chunk acknowledgments with periodic progress updates
   - Maintained end-to-end verification with MD5
   - Added explicit data channel configuration parameters

3. **Validated Signaling Server**:
   - Confirmed the server correctly implements the signaling protocol
   - Verified token assignment, connection request/response, and WebRTC signaling
   - Determined no changes needed to the server implementation

4. **Designed New CLI Client Architecture**:
   - Created a design document with component breakdown
   - Focused on simplicity and robustness
   - Emphasized separation of concerns
   - Designed to avoid deadlocks and race conditions
   - Specified a simple, IRC-like interface

5. **Updated Memory Bank**:
   - Created activeContext.md with current focus and issues
   - Created progress.md with implementation plan
   - Created .clinerules with project intelligence
   - Created cli-design.md with detailed architecture

## Next Steps

1. **Begin CLI Client Implementation**:
   - Start with the basic UI framework
   - Implement WebSocket connection to signaling server
   - Implement WebRTC connection establishment
   - Add chat functionality
   - Implement file transfer protocol

2. **Browser Client Implementation**:
   - Design simplified browser client architecture
   - Implement updated protocol
   - Ensure compatibility with CLI client

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test CLI-to-browser transfers
   - Test with various file sizes and network conditions
   - Validate protocol compliance in both implementations

## Decision Summary

We've decided to:
1. Keep the existing signaling server implementation
2. Rebuild both client implementations from scratch
3. Simplify the protocol by leveraging WebRTC's reliability guarantees
4. Use a simpler UI approach for the CLI client
5. Ensure strict protocol compliance in both implementations

This approach will address the core issues while maintaining the project's goals of secure, reliable peer-to-peer file transfers.
